# citibike-station-tracker
A little koa app that tracks available citibikes in NYC.

I whipped this up to get familiar with Koa and generators in general. It's also (I think) my first time using Leaflet!

Get the locations of citibike stations and the number of available bikes, quick as the wind.

_How Do You Do?_

`npm install`

`node --harmony app`
